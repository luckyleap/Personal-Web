		<h3>Tracker iPhone App</h3>
		<p>Currently in development, an app that tracks your daily activities on the iPhone</p>
		<h3>Zero-shot Recognition</h3>
		<p>This is a computer vision project that is implemented based off of <a href="http://attributes.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/">Christoph Lampert's paper</a> in matlab. Given SIFT and HoG descriptors of specific attributes from 40 different training animal classes, the project aimed to classify 10 unknown animal test cases that contain the different attributes trained from the prior classes. The result was a 25% accuracy in successfully classifying new animals based on SIFT and HoG trained attributes. Accuracy will likely improve if I had used more features for each classes.</p>
		
		<h3>Pedestrian Detection</h3>
		<p>This is another computer vision project that uses HoG features of pedestrians and classifies through SVM 
		training. The implementation is based on the <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf">paper by Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs</a>. The procedure involves training fixed frame sizes of pedestrians and scan over a given image searching for matching pedestrian frames. 
		
		<h3>Scene Categorization</h3>
		<p>Another computer vision project that uses SIFT features to categorize given scenes of kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms given training images and test images. This implementation is based on the <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~slazebni/publications/cvpr06b.pdf">paper by Svetlana Lazebnik</a> which utilizes a spatial pyramid representation to split the given scene into multiple sections and extract features with differential weights based on each section.</p>
		
		<h3>Video Frame Search</h3>
		<p>Using a bag of words approach and SIFT descriptors, this project searches through a movie for matching area of a frame with other frames within the movie.</p>

		<h3>Feature Extraction</h3>
		<p>Implement SIFT extraction on several images, following <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf"> the paper by David Lowe</a>.</p>

		<h3>Content Aware Resizing</h3>
		<p>This project aimed to resize the image through seam carving pixels with low energy, creating resized image that keeps the contents of the image as described in <a href="http://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf">Shai Avidan's paper</a>.</p>

		<h3>Simple Two-Level File System</h3>
		<p>This project utilized <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a>, an open source linux kernel extension to implement a user space program that allows for a simple two level file system. The resulting file system can thus call: stat, mkdir, ls, write, read, and unlink (delete).
